## Getting Started

These instructions will get you to set up the environment on your local machine to run this program. It is a command line program.

Step 1: Create a new VM in Virtual Box.\
Step 2: Download the image [SEEDUbuntu-16.04-32bit.zip](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) from here.\
Step 3: Use the Virtual Machine Hard Disk file to setup your VM.\
Step 4: Configure the VM.

The [link](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) contains a document that can be used to set up the VM without any issues.

## Motivation
This project was completed as a part of the Natural Language Processing class. The project was used to demonstrate knowledge in the various fields of natural language processing. This included using Tf-IDF and cosine similarity as well as grammar transformations to parse through the corpus of text.
